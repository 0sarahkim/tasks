# Tasks & Testing

This repository contains a simple task manager -- something someone may use as a todo list, perhaps.

You'll find a basic implementation in the `tasks.py` file, and some tests in `test_tasks.py`.
As a first step, you should read through both and ensure you understand them.

What's here is a start -- we can create new tasks, mark them complete and list them.
